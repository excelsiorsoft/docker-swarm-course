## docker-swarm-course

This repository accompanies my experiments while attending [Docker Swarm course](https://www.safaribooksonline.com/library/view/docker-swarm/9781788398251/) 

The original author's [code and notes](https://github.com/excelsiorsoft/docker-swarm-course/blob/master/V08278_Code.zip) downloaded from Packt has been extracted into folders corresponding to course's chapters.

My own chapter notes are added to the same corresponding folders in `my-notes.txt` files
